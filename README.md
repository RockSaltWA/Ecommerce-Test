# Ecommerce-Test

Heyo! For specifically the queries you asked me to do, you can just check the "TEST_Queries.sql" file. However, I wanted to append the "Table_Creation.sql" and "Data_Insertion.sql" in addition, as I ended up making my own custom dataset just to verify the queries actually work, and I figured it could help you get maybe a better understanding of the work I do as well :P. Thanks again, I hope this suffices!
